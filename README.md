### Setting up a local istance
If you want to test the bot by creating your personal istance, follow this steps:
* **Clone this repository** or download it as zip.
* **Send a message to your bot** on Telegram, even '/start' will do. If you don't, you could get an error
* Copy the file resources/config/settings.yml.dist into resources/config/settings.yml and insert your configuration (If you don't have a token, message Telegram's [@BotFather](http://telegram.me/Botfather) to create a bot and get a token for it)
* Now you can compile it:
```
$ mvn package
```
and execute it :
```
$ cd target/
